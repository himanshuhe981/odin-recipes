        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            My mom's 7-layer dip is a big hit at all small gatherings! Refried beans are layered with guacamole, taco-seasoned sour cream, veggies, and cheese; it's perfect for dipping tortilla chips. The dip traditionally takes less time to disappear into bellies than it does to prepare.
